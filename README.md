# Harry Potter Kata #

To try and encourage more sales of the 5 different Harry Potter books they sell, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts of multiple-book purchases.

One copy of any of the 5 books costs 8 EUR.

If, however, you buy 2 different books, you get a 5% discount on those 2 books.

If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.

If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.

If you buy all 5 different books, you get a 25% discount.

## Note ##

If you buy 4 books -3 of which are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the 4th book still costs 8 EUR.

Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only Harry Potter books), giving as big a discount as possible.

For example, how much does this basket of books cost?

2 copies of the 1st book, 2 copies of the 2nd book, 2 copies of the 3rd book, 1 copy of the 4th book, 1 copy of the 5th book.

Answer: 51.60 EUR
